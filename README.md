# Morganey [![Status Ventis](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ventis-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier)

[Lambda Calculus][wiki-lambda-calculus] based, interpreted programming
language that recognizes Church encoded structures.

## Usage ##

Before doing anything useful with Morganey you need to install
[sbt][scala-sbt] first.

### Samples ###

For language samples and examples please visit [docs/samples/][samples-dir] directory. To execute a sample run:

```console
$ sbt "run <path-to-sample>"
```

from the root of the source code directory. For example, to execute the 15 first fibonacci numbers sample run:

<!-- TODO(aa4e7fae-0a00-4af9-91c9-36bb6389ab99): Samples execution instructions don't work -->
```console
$ sbt "run docs/samples/fib.mgn"
```

For more information on executing Morganey programs please see [Program Execution](#program-execution) section.

### REPL ###

To run the REPL just enter the following in the source code directory

```console
$ sbt run
```

and start entring REPL commands there. You can enter

- `<term>` (see [Language](#language))
- `<binding>` (see [Language](#language))
- `<loading>` (see [Language](#language))
- `:exit` - exits the REPL
- `:raw <term>` - prints the representation of the term
- `:unbind <regex>` - clears either the current context, or all bindings matching the regex

The REPL will take the entered lambda term, beta-reduce it with the
normal order reduction strategy and output the normal form of the
entered lambda term.

To quit the REPL just `^C` it.

### Program Execution ###

To execute a program written in Morganey do the following:

```console
$ sbt "run main.mgn"
```

Where `main.mgn` is the name of the file that contains the
program. The program should provide an entry point. An entry point is
a binding with the name `main` which is bound to function of one
argument:

    main := \input . ...

For more information see [Execution Semantic][execution-semantic]

### As a Thirdparty Dependency ###

Morganey is available on [JCenter][jcenter].

#### sbt ####

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "me.rexim" %% "morganey" % "0.1.0"
)
```

### Unit Tests ###

To run the Unit Tests enter the following in the source code directory

```console
$ sbt clean coverage test
$ sbt coverageReport
$ sbt coverageAggregate
```

And after that you can take a look at the Unit Test coverage
results. Just open `target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report/index.html`
with your favorite browser.

### Functional Tests ###

```console
$ sbt funtests
```

### Build an uberjar ###

To build an uberjar run the following command

```console
$ sbt assembly
```

After that find the uberjar at `target/scala-2.11/morganey.jar`

### Custom sbt commands ###

This project introduces the following custom sbt commands:

- `sbt build`: Compiles the subprojects `kernel`, `macros` and
  `stdlib` and copies the resulting JAR files into the target directory
  of the root project.

- `sbt buildModuleIndex`: Traverses the stdlib subproject and creates
  a resource file containing a list of modules - the so-called
  [module-index]. This command is run automatically if you `sbt
  compile` the project.

- `sbt rebuild`: Alias for the execution of the commands `sbt clean`
  and `sbt build`.

- `sbt retest`: Alias for the execution of the commands `sbt rebuild`
  and `sbt test`.

### Comments ###

In Morganey there are two types of comments: single-line (starting
with double slash `//`, extending to the end of the line) and
multi-line comments (any text, surrounded by `/*` and `*/`).
